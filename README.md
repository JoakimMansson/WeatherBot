# WeatherBot
 
A weatherbot which will notify me of the weather of today. Such as averages, highest and lowest values for humidity, rain...  All functionality is using a selenium web scraper bot programmed to first go into klart.se which is a weather site and which then scrapes all useful data. Then heading over to my class schedule and deciding wheter I need an umbrella when heading to school or when going home. All depending on when I have my classes.
